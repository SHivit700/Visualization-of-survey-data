# Visualization-of-survey-data
Repo for Visualization of survey data(JetBrains Project). 

"npm install" should install all necessary dependancies.

To use the LLM, you need to get an apiKey from google cloud services by creating a project there and enabling Cloud Natural Language API and creating an API key.

Create a .env with the API key in format("REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY={apiKey}")

If doing the above always returns the mood as neutral then kindly contact me and I will run the program using my API key.
